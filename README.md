# javaFxWeatherApp

## Description
It's a small application that can make API requests using Visualcrossing's (https://www.visualcrossing.com/) API and represent the data as a user-friendly GUI.
The API's data is represented as JSON, I use a parser to process it.
The application has basic functions, like location searching (worldwide) and showing information like the actual day's weather, conditions, UV-index, pressure, moon phase, etc.. and the location information, time, and GMT...
It can check the whole week's weather in 3-hour intervals. 

Later, I want to add features, like:
- Advanced location searching
- More detailed weather representation
- Ability to check the daily weather
- Updating data in intervals

The project is just a home project for learning purposes, the API key is registered under my name and it is limited to 1000 requests/day.
